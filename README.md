# console-feed-node-transform

Modified from [console-feed](https://github.com/samdenty/console-feed), which is originally for browser, but I need its Encode/Decode functions in Node.js, this how the fork repo comes.

## Usage

```cmd
$ npm i console-feed-node-transform
# or yarn add console-feed-node-transform
```

## Thanks
